# Orbit osquery

Orbit is Fleet's [osquery](https://github.com/osquery/osquery) runtime and autoupdater. With Orbit, it's easy to deploy osquery, manage configurations, and stay up to date. Orbit eases the deployment of osquery connected with a [Fleet server](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet), and is a (near) drop-in replacement for osquery in a variety of deployment scenarios.

## FAQs

### How does Orbit compare with Kolide Launcher?

Orbit is inspired by the success of [Kolide Launcher](https://github.com/kolide/launcher), and approaches a similar problem domain with new strategies informed by the challenges encountered in real world deployments.

- Both Orbit and Launcher use [The Update Framework](https://theupdateframework.com/) specification for managing updates. Orbit utilizes the official [go-tuf](https://github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf) library, while Launcher has it's own implementation of the specification.
- Orbit can be deployed as a (near) drop-in replacement for osquery, supporting full customization of the osquery flags. Launcher heavily manages the osquery flags making deployment outside of Fleet or Kolide's SaaS difficult.
- Orbit prefers the battle-tested plugins of osquery. Orbit uses the built-in logging, configuration, and live query plugins, while Launcher uses custom implementations.
- Orbit prefers the built-in osquery remote APIs. Launcher utilizes a custom gRPC API that has led to issues with character encoding, load balancers/proxies, and request size limits.
- Orbit encourages use of the osquery performance Watchdog, while Launcher disables the Watchdog.

Additionally, Orbit aims to tackle problems out of scope for Launcher:

- Configure updates via release channels, providing more granular control over agent versioning.
- Support for deploying and updating osquery extensions (ðŸ”œ).
- Manage osquery versions and startup flags from a remote (Fleet) server (ðŸ”œ).
- Further control of osquery performance via cgroups (ðŸ”œ).

### Is Orbit Free?

Yes! Orbit is licensed under an MIT license and all uses are encouraged.
