# Orbit osquery

Orbit is an [osquery](https://github.com/osquery/osquery) runtime and autoupdater. With Orbit, it's easy to deploy osquery, manage configurations, and stay up to date. Orbit eases the deployment of osquery connected with a [Fleet server](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet), and is a (near) drop-in replacement for osquery in a variety of deployment scenarios.

Orbit is the recommended agent for Fleet. But Orbit can be used with or without Fleet, and Fleet can be used with or without Orbit.

## Try Orbit

#### With [`fleetctl preview` already running](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet#try-fleet) and [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) installed:

```bash
# From within the top-level directory of this repoâ€¦
# Generate a macOS installer pointed at your local Fleet
go run ./cmd/package --type=pkg --fleet-url=localhost:8412 --insecure --enroll-secret=YOUR_FLEET_ENROLL_SECRET_HERE
```

> With fleetctl preview running, you can find your Fleet enroll secret by selecting the "Add new host" button on the Hosts page in the Fleet UI.

An installer configured to point at your Fleet instance has now been generated.

Now run that installer (double click, on a Mac) to enroll your own computer as a host in Fleet. Refresh after several seconds (â‰ˆ30s), and you should now see your local computer as a new host in Fleet.
